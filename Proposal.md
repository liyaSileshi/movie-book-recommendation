**Liya Tilahun** 


**Movie, Music and Book Recommendation** 


**Is your project New or Old?** New


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description

**During the break, I started studying python for datascience to get a headstart for term 4. I then got interested in Machine learning and one of the cool learning projects to do was recommendation engine. I have tried implementing the movie recommendation. During this intensive I hope to make the program more efficient and find recent dataset for movies, books and music so that I could implement the full program. It will be a great way for me to learn python libraries for DS and Machine Learning.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

* Finding a good dataset to work with
* Cleaning the dataset
* Making a front-end UI
* Use python libraries for the program
* Create a local storage in js so users can add/save their favoirite recommendation


## Skateboard

**Use libraries to make the movie recommendation working and make it so that users can type a movie name and get recommendations(backend part).**


## Bike

**Find a dataset for books and music. Clean the dataset and work on their recommendation.** 


## Car

**Make it so that users can add their favorite recommendation to their local storage(database).** 
**Make a nice and clean UI**
